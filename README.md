- Does the graph have the same characteristics of a random or a power-law network?
  </br></br>
- Which are the most important nodes, with respect to a given centrality measure?
  </br></br>
- Are the paths short with respect to the size of the network?
  </br></br>
- Is the network dense?
  </br></br>
- Is the network assortative?
  </br></br>
- And so on
